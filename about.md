Currently engineering [Firefox for Android][fxa] at [Mozilla][moz]. The
mobile space engages me by putting technology in the hands of people to
empower improvements to everyday life. The web excites me by making
information openly accessible to learners of kinds (I'm looking at *you*,
[Wikipedia][wiki]). It's the best of both worlds!

As a developer, my particular interest is in writing maintainable,
well-architected, and readable code -- as [one of my coworkers][grisha]
once said, developers are just users of code! My current research has
taken me to the hallowed halls of functional programming. I am also
enthusiastic about the use of tooling (e.g. static analysis and testing)
to ensure code quality.

When I'm not pushing my brain to the limits of abstraction, I enjoy
discovering the eccentricities of humanity (especially my own!) and
keeping healthy.
