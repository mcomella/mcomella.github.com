Hey there! I'm Michael Comella, a software developer. I believe in putting the user first – that software should be fast, easy-to-use, reliable, and safe. As developers, our greatest asset to that end is simplicity. My core expertise is in Android development and performance optimization which have been honed through my most recent employment by [Mozilla][].

I've previously worked on the Firefox browsers including desktop [Firefox], [Firefox for Android][fxa], [Focus], and [Firefox for Fire TV][fftv] in both the application developer and performance engineer roles. I also worked as the performance tech lead for the Firefox for Android rewrite codenamed Fenix.

Outside of Mozilla, I work on the occassional side project. I'm most proud of:
- [APT GitHub Improvements][apt]: a browser add-on to improve my team's workflow on GitHub
- [w3d-renderer][w3d]: a partial reimplentation of the Wolfenstein 3D renderer
