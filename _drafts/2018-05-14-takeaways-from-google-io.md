title: Takeaways From Google I/O

I had the privilege of attending Google I/O for the first time this year where I learned a lot about Google's near term vision for technology and, of course, many nitty gritty details that make delightful Android apps.

One of the most exciting aspects of the conference for me was discovering the humanist problems Google is addressing. It began in the keynote: Machine Learning (ML) is being used to diagnose ...

An issue that I find affects me
Digital wellbeing

Accessibility

Social good

Outside of these humanist issues, I'm always excited to see the expansion of human knowledge and it was enjoyable to see the ways Google is helping to push that forward. Recently, Machine Learning has been making many advances and one area Google emphasized this year was the convergence of ML and the many small devices from the Internet of Things (IoT). They're democratizing these technologies, allowing individuals and smaller enterprises to push forward human knowledge on their own. For ML, they're providing technologies like [Cloud AutoML][] (upload data and they'll produce a model), [ML Kit][] (high-level Machine Learning APIs for mobile devices), and [Cloud TPUs][] (access to their high-efficiency Tensor Processing Unit hardware). For IoT devices, they've created [Android Things][] which provides chips powerful enough to do ML on device as well as the tools to prototype, ship, and maintain new hardware products. I'm excited by the potential of these devices to explore areas we haven't had the opportunity to do before.

Looking to the future, [John Hennessy gave an interesting talk][future computing] on the near future of computing: he mentioned we're at the limits of what we can do with current hardware technology (power consumption becoming the limiting factor) and he forsees a future where computing will create more Domain Specific Archictectures (like GPUs and TPUs) in order to maximize performance in those domains. I recommend giving it a listen!

This all being said, this my interpretation of Google's vision of the near future. I'm curious for other's perspectives on these issues and the new frontiers of technology.
