I'm currently working on [performance for Firefox][perfblog] at [Mozilla]. As an individual in the tech industry, I'm interested in how technology can empower society to solve the problems individuals face in their day-to-day lives while simultaneously avoiding the disempowerment unthoughtful use of technology seems to generate.

As a software developer, I'm passionate about writing maintainable, readable code and the techniques that enable it:Â simplicity, programming paradigms, tooling, etc. My primary experience is working on the Firefox browsers for Android including [Firefox][fxa], [Focus], and [Firefox for Fire TV][fftv] in Kotlin and Java. I also use Python for scripting and have workable HTML/CSS/JS knowledge through browser development.

Outside of Mozilla, I work on the occassional side project. I'm most proud of:
- [APT GitHub Improvements][apt]: a browser add-on to improve my team's workflow on GitHub
- [w3d-renderer][w3d]: a partial reimplentation of the Wolfenstein 3D renderer
