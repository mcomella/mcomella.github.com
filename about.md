Currently engineering [Firefox Focus][focus] and [Firefox TV for Fire
TV][firetv] at [Mozilla][moz]. I'm particularly interested in how
technology can help people solve the tough problems they face in their
day-to-day lives and I'm delighted by the ways the web, as an open
platform for rapid communication and information, empowers users to
solve these problems.

As a developer, one strong passion of mine is in writing maintainable,
well-architected, and readable code. Relatedly, to improve code
quality, I'm enthusiastic about new programming trends like functional
programming and the use of tooling (e.g. static analysis and testing).

My primary experience is in Android mobile development with Java and
Kotlin.  I have a few months of professional experience on iOS
development with Swift, decent JavaScript skills (from browser
development), and workable HTML/CSS knowledge. I also have strong, albeit
infrequent, experience with Python for scripting and prototype web
servers. As a hobby, I've dabbled in clojure.
