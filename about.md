As an individual in the tech industry, I'm interested in how technology can empower society to solve the problems individuals face in their day-to-day lives while simultaneously avoiding the disempowerment unthoughtful use of technology seems to generate.

As a programmer, I'm passionate about fast, reliable, and elegant software and the techniques that enable it: programming paradigms, tooling, etc. I previously worked at [Mozilla] on the Firefox browsers including desktop [Firefox], [Firefox for Android][fxa], [Focus], and [Firefox for Fire TV][fftv] in both the application developer and performance engineer roles. I also worked as the performance tech lead for the Firefox for Android rewrite codenamed Fenix.

Outside of Mozilla, I work on the occassional side project. I'm most proud of:
- [APT GitHub Improvements][apt]: a browser add-on to improve my team's workflow on GitHub
- [w3d-renderer][w3d]: a partial reimplentation of the Wolfenstein 3D renderer
