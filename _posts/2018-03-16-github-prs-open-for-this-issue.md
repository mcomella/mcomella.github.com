When looking at a GitHub issue, I often need to know, "What PRs are open for this issue?" I wrote [the GitHub Issue Hoister add-on][addon] to address my problem.

It hoists those "mcomella added a commit that references this issue" links to the top of an issue page to make them easier to access and see at a glance:

Check out [the brief tutorial][tutorial] for caveats and more details, or just [download it off AMO][addon]. For bugs/issues, [file them on github][issues].
